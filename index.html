                            I'm a good person, I hope. But I'm never as good as I want to be, never as nice as I want to
                            be, never as generous as I want to be.

                                David Tennant made his debut as Romeo in the previews of the Royal Shakespeare Company's
                                Romeo and Juliet in Stratford-upon-Avon.

                                There's certainly something of the self-dramatist in Romeo. I think that's how he likes
                                to cast himself, even within his group of friends. He likes to see himself, and for them
                                to see him, as the slightly complicated, Byronic tortured soul, and what I think happens
                                is that he genuinely becomes that. Rather than it being a part he plays, it becomes his
                                life.

                                He had a very jovial outlook and would often tell jokes to cover his plans. He also
                                loved little shops! According to the Tenth Doctor, everywhere needed a little shop.

                                nostalgia.
